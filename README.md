# Python-Code-----COVID-19-Vaccination-Rollout-Worldwide
This repository contains Python code that does an exploratory analysis, various machine learning techniques and regression analysis to gather insights which would eventually be shown on a data dashboard using Tableau.


COVID Vaccinations Rollout Analysis project deals with performing exploratory analysis of the dataset in order to understand what factors drive the global vaccination rollout. In order to help with the analysis and strategy, Python code was written to understand the relationship between variables in order to determine what factors are important. The dataset that was used for analysis is an open-source dataset from Kaggle which contains information about daily vaccinations, the total number of people vaccinated, people fully vaccinated, among others. Regression Analysis and Clustering operations were performed to see how the data behaved with respect to different variables. In the end, all the findings were created on a dashboard using Tableau Public.
